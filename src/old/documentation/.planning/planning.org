* Plan
** Architecture
*** DRAFT 1
**** MODEL 1

[[./Architecture_1.png]]

The above diagrma is the first architecture plan.
Pros:
+ Strong separation between UI and backend. Can work on both separately without too much worry.
+ Data can just be stored in common format appropriate for IPC; no need to worry
  about how it appears in memory off the bat
+ In theory, if network comm is used, this architecture allows the backend to either
  run locally or on another machine, without (too much) worry about implementation details

Cons:
- Potential latency between UI events and result - especially if using network interface
- Inconvenience of having to run multiple processes and communicate over network (even if
  localhost) - however, this does not change how the deliverable is packaged. Can still
  run as one binary.

If latency is an issue, model 2 might be better
